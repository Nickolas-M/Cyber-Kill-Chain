# The Cyber Kill Chain
The Cyber Kill Chain breaks down the steps taken by threat actors into 7 stages. Cyber Security teams can use
this model to help defend against in progress attacks and stop them before they impact an organization. The 7
steps include Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command & Control (C2), and Actions on Objectives. Each step is vital to performing a sophisticated attack, often carried out by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Disrupting any step allows security teams to recognize, prevent, and mitigate attacks.

## Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is the data gathering stage, discovering possible threat vectors that can be used to carry out an attack on their target. Threat actors attempt to obtain all releveant public information such as employee social media profiles, internet facing servers, email addresses, phone numbers, etc. Threat actors will attempt to find vulnerabilities and potential entry points within an organizations technologies. The more information gathered the better a threat actor can tailor their attacks towards the target. 

## Weaponization
The weaponization phase focuses on the malware and delivery methods intended to be used throughout the cyber attack. Threat actors create new and adapt old malware optimized to best exploit the targeted organization weaknesses. Using the vital information gathered in the reconnaissance phase to tailor their tools. Increasing their chances of operational success and reducing the likelihood of being detected.

## Delivery
Threat actors attempt to initiate the attack by launching the malware developed in the weaponization phase. Attackers will often use social engineering tactics like phishing or exploit vulnerabilities found in an organization. Multiple delivery methods can be used in unison to increase the effectiveness and success of the attack. 

## Exploitation
Once a threat actor successfully infiltrates an organization, the malware they delivered is executed. Attackers will attempt to move laterally throughout an organizations systems, attempting to discover sensitive data, higher privileged accounts, and weaknesses to gain more access within the organization. Making calculated movements to further propel access and control within the organizations systems increasing the attackers capabilities.
